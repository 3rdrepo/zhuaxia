### Proxy setting

**Download Xiami resources outside China**

Both xiami.com and music.163(Netease) block http Requests from IP addresses outside China. For 163 resources, zhuaxia uses a url that so far (2015-11-12) still working for oversea IP direct downloading. However this won't last long. For stable usage, please read the below section about the proxy option.

In configuration file adding property (if it doesn't exist): `china.proxy.http=ip:port` (before it was called `xiami.proxy.http`) can let zhuaxia download resources via proxy.

For example:

	china.proxy.http=127.0.0.1:8080

The `ip:port` is http proxy in China, so that we can send request with Chinese IP. If your machine has already an IP in China. You don't need this option. You can remove or comment this property out.

**Tip**: finding a China proxy: Go to http://proxy-list.org/ then search country "China"

**Considering the users' existing config, the option `xiami.proxy.http` is still usable too. The proxy will be applied for both xiami and 163 song downloading. However changing the option name in config is recommended. Old and new options cannot be used together.**
